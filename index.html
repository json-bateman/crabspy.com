              <li>Goal of the Game</li>
              <ul class="desc">
                Players take turns asking each other questions about the
                location. The goal is to identify the spy if you are a non-spy
                <span>or</span>
                figure out the location if you are the spy. Non-spies should ask
                questions that are vague enough to not give away the location,
                but specific enough to try and identify the spy.
              </ul>
              <li>Begin Round</li>
              <ul class="desc">
                The most dashing among the group of players asks the first
                question. They can ask any player any question they like, the
                person who was asked a question asks the next question to anyone
                except for the person who just previously asked them a question.
              </ul>
              <li>Main Gameplay Loop</li>
              <ul class="desc">
                Players continue to ask questions in round robin fashion until
                they are confident enough to vote on a spy. The gametime
                defaults to 8 minutes.
              </ul>
              <li>Three Ways to End the Round</li>
              <ol>
                <li class="three-ways">Time Is Up!</li>
                <ul class="desc">
                  When time runs out, each player makes an accusation, starting
                  with the player who led (the most dashing). The accused cannot
                  vote, if the vote is not unanimous it proceeds to the next
                  player until there is a unanimous vote. The spy wins if
                  everyone has voted and no decision is made, or a non-spy gets
                  incorrectly accused.
                </ul>
                <li class="three-ways">A Player Gets Suspicious</li>
                <ul class="desc">
                  Each player may stop the clock once per round and make an
                  accusation. The accusation is then voted on, the person who is
                  accused cannot vote. If the vote is unanimous the game ends,
                  if the spy is accused non-spies win and visa versa. If the
                  vote is not unanimous the timer is resumed and play continues.
                </ul>
                <li class="three-ways">At the Spy's Request</li>
                <ul class="desc">
                  The spy may reveal himself and claim the location, if he is
                  correct he wins, if not the non-spies win.
